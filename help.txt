Matrix Operations: 

For defining matrices, there must be a string on the left side of the '='
and a matrix (following the Matrix syntax given above) on the right of the '='. 

There must be an '=' when defining matrices.

Valid Syntax: a = a_11, a_12; a_21, a_22
Valid Syntax: my_matrix = [a_11, a_12]; [a_21, a_22]
Invalid Syntax: [[a_11, a_12]; [a_21, a_22]]

For specifying a matrix equation, general operation rules must be followed
(e.g. operations must have an argument surrounding it on each side, 
matrix dimensions for a given operation must be valid).

Valid operations for Matrix Operations are:
- (Matrix subtraction)
+ (Matrix addition)
* (Matrix multiplication)
^ (Scalar multiplication)
~ (Unary negation)

Note that scalar multiplication must be denoted with a '^' and must contain a 
scalar one one side of the '^'. 

Also note that unary negation (of a scalar) must be denoted 
with a '~', not a '-'. The '~' must come before the scalar. 
This is not the case for the construction of matrices 
(i.e. '-1.4' is a valid element when defining a matrix). 

Double negation (i.e. '~~1' = '1') is not supported. 

Also note that above operations are written in order with respect to 
the order of operations (the first on the list having the lowest priority 
and the last on the list having the greatest priority).

Valid Syntax: a+b
Valid Syntax: 3^d
Valid Syntax: c    *b+a
Valid Syntax: ~4
Valid Syntax: a^~3
Valid Syntax: ~1.4^c -   b ^4*a  
Valid Syntax: c-~3^b
Valid Syntax: a*b-c^4.1+d

Above syntaxes are valid assuming a,b,c,d are previously defined matrices 
with correct dimensions given the operations carried out on them.
 
Note that parentheses are not supported with Matrix Operations and equations 
will be parsed according to the order of operations. 

Also note that ragged matrices (matrices with undefined dimensions) 
are not supported with Matrix Operations.
 
Invalid Syntax: d=c+b
Invalid Syntax: 3d
Invalid Syntax: 4.1*c+d
Invalid Syntax: b^-4
Invalid Syntax: ~b
Invalid Syntax: -b
Invalid Syntax: 4~
Invalid Syntax: b~a
Invalid Syntax: a*(b-c)+d
